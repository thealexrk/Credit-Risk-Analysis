NB: This project is inspired by a tutorial by Qiskit  (which can be found here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/finance/09_credit_risk_analysis.ipynb), to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the code I used. This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Quantum Computing.
